Part 1
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)


accidents = read.csv("accident.csv")
person = read.csv("person.csv")
vehicle = read.csv("vehicle.csv")

accidents
accidents %>% head()

nrow(accidents)

ncol(accidents)

summary(accidents)


acc1 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 1)
nrow(acc1) ##5303 rows, so there were 5303 accounts at day 1 Sunday

acc2 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 2)
nrow(acc2) ## 4501 rows, so there were 4501 accounts at day 2 Monday

acc3 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 3)
nrow(acc3) ## 4219 rows, so there were 4219 accounts at day 3 Tuesday

acc4 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 4)
nrow(acc4) ## 4388 rows, so there were 4388 accounts at day 4 Wednesday

acc5 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 5)
nrow(acc5) ## 4662 rows, so there were 4662 accounts at day 5 Thursday

acc6 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 6)
nrow(acc6) ## 5352 rows, so there were 5352 accounts at day 6 Friday

acc7 <- filter(accidents, accidents$DAY_WEEK == 7)
nrow(acc7) ## 6104 rows, so there were 6104 accounts at day 7 Saturday


## The most amount of accidents occurred on day 7 or Saturday.

## The below code is an easier way to filter the above code.  The results are congruent.

daySum = accidents %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% summarize(n = n())

##Sum 
daySum

accidents %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY_WEEK)) + geom_bar() + xlab("day")

accidentSum = accidents %>% filter(HOUR<=24) %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% summarize(n = n())
## The most amount of accidents happens at 6PM, this makes sense due to the amount of traffic that occurrs during those times.

accidentSum %>% ggplot(aes(x= HOUR, y = n)) + geom_col()
##Visualization of this trend

drunkSum = accidents %>% group_by(DRUNK_DR) %>% summarize(n = n())
## The number of accidents with atleast 1 drunk driver is 8720.

sum(drunkSum$n[c(2:4)])


```



Part 2
```{r}

person %>% head()

joined = inner_join(person, accidents, by ="ST_CASE")

p1 = joined %>% filter(PER_TYP == 1)

p1 %>% head()
```

```{r}
##Sums the days based on accidents
sumOfDay = p1 %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% summarize(n = n())
sumOfDay

##Sums the hours of the day based on accidents
sumOfHour = p1 %>% group_by(HOUR.y) %>% summarize(n = n())
sumOfHour


##Sums the number of accidents based on gender
sumOfGender = p1 %>% filter(SEX < 3) %>% group_by(SEX) %>% summarize(n = n())
sumOfGender

##An overall sum of all variables
OverallSum = p1 %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK, HOUR.y,SEX) %>% summarize(n = n())
OverallSum

##A plot showing the accidents per day
sumOfDay %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY_WEEK, y = n)) + geom_col()

##A plot showing the accidents varied by the hours of the day
sumOfHour %>% filter(HOUR.y < 25) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR.y, y = n)) + geom_col()

##A simple column chart showing the number of accidents per gender
sumOfGender %>% ggplot(aes(x = SEX, y = n,fill = as.factor(SEX))) + geom_col() + ylab("count")
